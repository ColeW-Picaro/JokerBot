# JokerBot

This is inspired by the ebooks bots from days of old.

Using this requires two files not provided, `quotes.txt` and `oauth.txt`:

`quotes.txt` has one quote to be tweeted on each line, nothing else.

`oauth.txt` has 4 lines with the twitter API keys in your twitter application. Put them in the order of API key, API secret, Access key, Access secret.

Enjoy
